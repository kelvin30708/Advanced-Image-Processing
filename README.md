a program which can read and write image files with different format
### Homework 2: Image histogram 
a function which can show the histogram of an image through extended Homework
### Homework 3: Generation of additive, zero mean Gaussian noise
add a new function which can generate additive, zero mean Gaussian noises in HW2.
### Homework 4: Discrete wavelet transform
add a new function which can process discrete wavelet transform.
### Homework 5: Histogram equalization
add a new function which can do histogram equalization in HW3.
### Homework 6: Image smoothing and edge detection
add one convolution function in HW1, which can do image smoothing and edge detection respectively using different convolution masks
